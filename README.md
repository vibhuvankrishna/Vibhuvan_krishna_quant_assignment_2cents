1. Objective
The primary objective is not to build a profitable portfolio, but to engineer a scientifically rigorous, event-driven trading system capable of managing a diverse portfolio of alphas across multiple assets and timeframes. The core challenge remains replication: ensuring that the portfolio-level results from your backtest can be perfectly reproduced in a live-trading simulation.

2. The Core Choice: Your Path (Unchanged)
You must still choose one of two tracks:

Track A: The "Full-Stack Quant" (Build from Scratch)
Track B: The "Alpha Integrator" (Use Nautilus Trader)
The requirements for each track are the same, but the complexity of managing 5 concurrent strategies is now much higher. Your DataHandler (Track A) or DataClient adapters (Track B) must now efficiently manage and synchronize data across different symbols and timeframes (e.g., 1-minute bars, 1-hour bars, and ticks).

3. Phase I: Framework & Broker Connectivity (Unchanged)
Your system must still connect to and abstract:

Binance (Crypto): Binance Testnet
Interactive Brokers (Equities/FX): IBKR Paper Trading Account
Zerodha (Indian Equities): Zerodha Kite Sandbox
4. Phase II: Alpha Development & Portfolio
You must develop, test, and deploy a portfolio of (at least) five distinct alphas. Your system must run these concurrently, managing their positions and risk collectively.

5. Phase III: Rigorous Testing
This phase is now more complex as you must test both individual alphas and the combined portfolio.

Backtesting
Run backtests for each alpha individually and for the combined portfolio.
Report: Generate a full quantstats report for the portfolio-level equity curve. You must also report on correlation between your alphas. Are they truly distinct?
Hyper-Parameter Tuning (HPT)
Perform HPT (e.g., Optuna) for at least two parameters on two different alphas (e.g., Alpha 1's z-score and Alpha 3's MTF lookbacks).
Discuss the computational challenge of tuning a portfolio.
Walk-Forward Optimization (WFO)
Perform a rolling WFO on the entire portfolio.
Report: Plot the In-Sample vs. Out-of-Sample portfolio equity curves. This demonstrates the robustness of your entire alpha-generation process.
6. Phase IV: Deployment & The Replication Mandate
This is the final test, now for all 5 alphas.

Sandbox Deployment
Deploy your system on a server.
Run your full portfolio of 5 alphas till the deadline on the Binance, IBKR, and Zerodha sandbox environments simultaneously.
Your system must log all market data, signals, orders, and fills for all 5 alphas.
The Replication Test (The "Must-Match" Requirement)
Take the raw, timestamped market data logs your system collected for all assets.
Feed this exact data stream into your backtester's "replay" mode.
The requirement: The trade log and final P&L generated by this "replay backtest" must perfectly match the trade log and P&L from your 1-week sandbox run, on a per-alpha and portfolio-level basis.
7. Final Submission
Git Repository: Your complete, well-documented codebase.
The Replication Log (results.json):
A single JSON file comparing the backtest and sandbox results for all 5 alphas.
